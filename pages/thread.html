<h2 style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Threat Intelligence Management</h2>


<p  style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Threat intelligence management is the practice of aggregating, analyzing, enriching, and de-duplicating internal and external threat data in order to understand threats to your environment. </p>


<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Threat intelligence is a critical component of modern cybersecurity practices. It refers to the knowledge and insights gained from analyzing data related to potential and current cyber threats. This information helps organizations understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors and empowers them to make informed decisions to safeguard their systems and data.

	<h2 style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Manufacturing</h2>
<p  style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Manufacturing was the top-attacked
industry and by a slightly larger margin
compared to 2021. In 2022, backdoors
were deployed in 28% of incidents, beating
out ransomware, which appeared in 23%
of incidents remediated by X-Force. The
percentage of backdoor deployments also
was driven by the Emotet infection spike.
Some of these cases could have led to
ransomware attacks, among other more
malicious activity, but they were identifed
early enough to be remediated.
Spear phishing attachments and
exploitation of public-facing applications
tied for the top two infection vectors
at 28% each. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Finance and insurance </h2>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Finance and insurance organizations made
up less than one in fve attacks to which
X-Force responded in 2022, earning it
second place. This percentage indicated a
slight decrease over the past few years as
other industries began to gain the attention
of attackers, particularly manufacturing.
Finance and insurance organizations
tend to be further along in both digital
transformations and cloud adoption
progress relative to other industries. As a
result, attackers may need to work harder
to successfully execute attacks against
these organizations.
Backdoor attacks were the most commonly
observed action on objective at 29%,
followed by ransomware and maldocs at
11% each. The top infection vector was
spear phishing attachments, used in 53%
of attacks against this sector. Exploitation
of public-facing applications came in
second place at 18% of attacks, and spear
phishing links were the initial access vector
at 12% of cases.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Government </h2>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Government targets were another top
target of backdoors, comprising 25% of
X-Force IR cases. This percentage tied
with DDoS attacks, which also accounted
for one-quarter of cases. The rich sensitive
information in public sector networks
is a common target of cyber espionage
campaigns. This information can include
extensive databases of PII and other
information that could be used by statesponsored groups or sold for proft by
cybercriminals. Maldocs were identifed in
17% of cases, and cryptominers, credential
acquisition tools, ransomware and web
shells split the remainder of cases at 83%.
Of the cases in this sector, X-Force was
able to tie incidents to cybercriminals,
insider threats that led to data destruction,
hacktivists and state-sponsored threat
groups conducting espionage, each in
equal proportion.
Exploitation of public-facing applications
and spear phishing attachments were the
lead infection vectors at 40% each, while
abuse of valid default accounts comprised
20%. Government entities in Asia-Pacifc
were the most targeted at 50% of cases,
with Europe at 30% and North America
at 20%.</p>

X-Force responded, coming in last place
for the second year running. Abuse of
external remote services, such as VPNs
and other access mechanisms, and valid
domain accounts were the observed
infection vectors. These vectors led to
ransomware attacks. The actions observed
in these cases included deployment of
ransomware and data exfltration tools.

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: -93px;">Down from seventh place in 2021,
transportation returned to its 2020 ranking
of ninth place. However, the industry still
comprised roughly the same percentage
of incidents to which X-Force responded.
Phishing was the most common initial
access vector in 51% of cases—evenly
split between links, attachments and spear
phishing as a service. Abuse of valid local
accounts made up 33% of initial access
vectors, with valid cloud accounts serving
as the entry point for 17% of cases. The top
actions on objectives were server access
and deployment of remote access tools at
25% each, followed by spam campaigns,
ransomware, backdoors and defacement in
13% of cases each.
Data theft was most common in 50%
of cases, with extortion and impacts to

goods to consumers and wholesalers.
Wholesalers are typically responsible for
the transportation and distribution of these
goods directly from manufacturers to
retailers or directly to consumers. The retail
and wholesale industry was the ffth-most
targeted industry, according to X-Force IR
data, the same as its 2021 ranking.
The most common initial access vector

spear phishing emails with a malicious link

services, spear phishing with malicious
