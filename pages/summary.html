              <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The average cost of a data breach reached
a record high in 2022.
The global average total cost of a data breach increased by
USD 0.11 million to USD 4.35 million in 2022, the highest it’s
been in history. The increase from USD 4.24
million in the 2021 report to USD 4.35 million in the 2022 report
represents a 2.6% increase. In the last two years, the average
total cost has increased 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the
2020 report.

              <p style="text-align:justify;">
                
                The global per record cost of a data breach in 2022 was
USD 164, a 1.9% increase from USD 161 in 2021. The increase
from USD 146 in 2020 is an increase of 12.3%. This study
examines breaches sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records.
It’s not consistent with this research to use the per record
cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches above
102,000 records. For more information, see the “Research
methodology” section.

About 83% of organizations studied have had more
than one data breach.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">
                  Eighty-three percent of organizations studied have experienced 
                  more than one data breach, and just 17% said this was their 
                  first data breach. Sixty percent of organizations studied stated 
                  that they increased the price of their services or products 
                  because of the data breach.
                </p>
            

            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              

Use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most 
common cause of a data breach. Stolen or compromised 
credentials were the primary attack vector in 19% of breaches in 
the 2022 study and also the top attack vector in the 2021 study, 
having caused 20% of breaches. Breaches caused by stolen or 
compromised credentials had an average cost of USD 4.50 million. 
These breaches had the longest lifecycle — 243 days to identify 
the breach, and another 84 days to contain the breach. Phishing 
was the second most common cause of a breach at 16% and 
also the costliest, averaging USD 4.91 million in breach costs.

data breach.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">
                  The average cost of a data breach for critical infrastructure
organizations studied was USD 4.82 million — USD 1 million
more than the average cost for organizations in other industries.
Critical infrastructure organizations included those in the
fnancial services, industrial, technology, energy, transportation,
communication, healthcare, education and public sector
industries. Twenty-eight percent experienced a destructive or
ransomware attack, while 17% experienced a breach because
of a business partner being compromised.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">
                  
                  Breaches at organizations with fully deployed security AI
and automation cost USD 3.05 million less than breaches at
organizations with no security AI and automation deployed. This
65.2% difference in average breach cost — between USD 3.15
million for fully deployed versus USD 6.20 million for not
deployed — represented the largest cost savings in the study.
Companies with fully deployed security AI and automation also
experienced on average a 74-day shorter time to identify and
contain the breach, known as the breach lifecycle, than those
without security AI and automation — 249 days versus 323 days.
The use of security AI and automation jumped by nearly one-ffth
in two years, from 59% in 2020 to 70% in 2022.

                  Healthcare breach costs hit a new record high. The average
breach in healthcare increased by nearly USD 1 million to reach
USD 10.10 million. Healthcare breach costs have been the most
expensive industry for 12 years running, increasing by 41.6%
since the 2020 report. Financial organizations had the second
highest costs — averaging USD 5.97 million — followed by
pharmaceuticals at USD 5.01 million, technology at USD 4.97
million and energy at USD 4.72 million.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">

Middle East at USD 7.46 million, Canada at USD 5.64 million, the
United Kingdom at USD 5.05 million and Germany at USD 4.85

Meanwhile, the country with the fastest growth rate over last

USD 1.38 million.
